> Example: `.au3` file open in **`Notepad++`** with the **`mGitHub`** theme.

The theme defaults to the `JetBrains Mono` font but works well with **Consolas** and most other monospaced fonts. You can change the font globally via the `Style Configurator` or in the `<GlobalStyles>` section of the theme file.
